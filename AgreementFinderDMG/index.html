Facebook: Is my server doing something wrong when contacting your server? I'll fix it immediately.<br>
Others: I wrote the entire server and iPhone app. In case you need a programmer, I have experience programming in C, Objective-C, and Java (not HTML of course). C server programming is my favorite. I kinda like iPhone programming. No comment on Java.<br>
